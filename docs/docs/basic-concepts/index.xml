      <description>Graph Based Data Model #  When we build a knowledge-graph, then we create a conceptual model of a part of the real World.
A conceptual model is a model of a subject area or area of knowledge, sometimes called a domain.
A domain model typically represents:
 the primary entities (the things of the domain), the relationships among entities, the attributes and attribute values (sometimes called properties and property values) of the entities and the relationships, and sometimes rules that associate entities, relationships, and attributes (or all three) in more complicated ways.</description>

      <description>Resources #  Resource #  The resource is a generic term, that we use both on the normal web and in the domain of semantic web. We usually mean a tangible or an abstract thing.
A resource has two important properties:
 it has unique identity, it can be represented (described in a way that holds each relevant properties of the resource).  Taken into consideration these two properties, we can say that the resource is compatible with the entity term of the Domain Driven Design methodology.</description>

      <description>Statements #  Subject, Predicate Object #  We use statements of facts to define knowledge. In general, we usually use declarative sentences to make statements of facts.
For example:
Luke Skywalker is 23 years old. or, in other words:
Luke Skywalker has age 23. It is possible to convert these declarative sentences into a subject-predicate-object structure.
Luke-Skywalker has-age 23. The parts of this sentence:
 subject: Luke-Skywalker, predicate: has-age, object: 23.</description>

      <description>Vocabularies #  Vocabulary #  One of the big advantages of using knowledge-graphs is that the domain knowledge of the subject area is represented and manipulated in the symbolic space, so it is relatively easy to understand for human beings. What is even more important, it is possible to obviously identify and transmit concepts among the information processing agents, whether they are humans or computers. This way the mapping of tangible physical things, and abstract concepts are possible without misunderstanding.</description>

      <title>Knowledge-Graph Representations</title>

      <description>Knowledge-Graph Representations #  In the previous sections we described, how can we make statements of facts by the application of resources, predicates and literal values. These statements are named triples.
We also introduced the concept of IRI, that makes possible to write unambiguous statements in standardized format, that are generally applicable. This way we have a simple solution to define the nodes and edges of the knowledge graph, including their labels, by the use of a plain text editor.</description>
