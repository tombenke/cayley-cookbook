    We research new approaches to machine reasoning and graph-based learning.
    We're working to build machines that can answer useful questions, using neural reasoning and knowledge graphs. We write articles, give talks and host workshops about our work.
    We're an open-source research organization and welcome you to join us and contribute.

  title: SuperMemo Website
  content: |
    SuperMemo is a program that keeps track of discrete bits of information you've learned and want to retain.
    SuperMemo tracks this so-called forgetting curve and reminds you to rehearse your knowledge when your chance of recalling it has dropped to, say, 90 percent.
    When you first learn a new vocabulary word, your chance of recalling it will drop quickly. But after SuperMemo reminds you of the word, the rate of forgetting levels out. The program tracks this new decline and waits longer to quiz you the next time.
