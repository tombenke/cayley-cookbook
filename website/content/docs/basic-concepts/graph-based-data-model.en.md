# Graph Based Data Model

Conceptual Model, or Domain

A conceptual model is a model of a subject area or area of knowledge, sometimes called a domain.

It represents:
- the primary entities (the things of the domain),
- the relationships among entities,
- the attributes and attribute values (sometimes called properties and property values) of the entities and the relationships,
- and sometimes rules that associate entities, relationships, and attributes (or all three) in more complicated ways.
