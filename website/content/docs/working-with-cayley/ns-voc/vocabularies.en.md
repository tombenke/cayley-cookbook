# Create a New Vocabulary

The following code demonstrates how can a new vocabulary be defined.
The `foaf.go` package defines the most frequently used terms of the [FOAF Vocabulary Specification](http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/).
This package is used by several other examples of the cookbook as a vocabulary to use some terms as predicates.
