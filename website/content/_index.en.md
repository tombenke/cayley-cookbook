[Cayley](https://github.com/cayleygraph/cayley) is an open-source database for Linked Data. It is inspired by the graph database behind Google's [Knowledge Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_Graph).

This website is a collection of code fragments, that use the 
[Cayley Knowledge Graph](https://github.com/cayleygraph/cayley) as a [Golang](https://golang.org/) library.

The [github.com/tombenke/cayley-cookbook-src](https://github.com/tombenke/cayley-cookbook-src/tree/master) repository holds the basic implementations of the most typical use-cases.about how to use Cayley as a Go library.
The individual use-cases are organized into subfolders.

The current {{< cayley >}} version is `0.7.5` at the time of this writing, so the examples were tested with this version.

The main purpose of this collection to make it easier to get started with using {{< cayley >}}.

There are two options to use examples:
1. The code examples can be immediately executed in the cloud.
[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/tombenke/cayley-cookbook-src)](https://repl.it/github/tombenke/cayley-cookbook-src)
2. Clone the [repository](https://github.com/tombenke/cayley-cookbook-src/tree/master) to your local machine, and execute there.

If you want to have a deeper insight about how {{< cayley >}} works, then I highly recomment to [install it](https://cayley.gitbook.io/cayley/installation) to your local machine as well as to clone the source repositories ([cayleygraph/cayley](https://github.com/cayleygraph/cayley/) and [cayleygraph/quad](https://github.com/cayleygraph/quad/)) of it too.
