## Cayley CookBook

[Cayley](https://github.com/cayleygraph/cayley) is an open-source database for Linked Data. It is inspired by the graph database behind Google's [Knowledge Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_Graph).

This website is a collection of code fragments, that use the 
[Cayley Knowledge Graph](https://github.com/cayleygraph/cayley) as a Golang library.

The [github.com/tombenke/cayley-cookbook](https://github.com/tombenke/cayley-cookbook/tree/master) repository holds the basic implementations of the most typical use-cases.about how to use Cayley as a Go library.
The individual use-cases are organized into subfolders.

The main purpose of this collection to make it easier to get started with using Caleygraph.

There are two options to use examples:
1. The code examples can be immediately executed in the cloud.
[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/tombenke/cayley-cokbook)](https://repl.it/github/tombenke/cayley-cookbook)
2. Clone the [repository](https://github.com/tombenke/cayley-cookbook/tree/master) to your local machine, and execute there.
